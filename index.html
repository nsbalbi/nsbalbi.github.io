		<h1>Hi!</h1>
		<p>
			My name is Nick, and I make math animations for fun (yes, really). I've put together this website to showcase some of them and to hopefully pass on the same wonder and fascination I've had for these concepts. Feel free to (in fact I encourage you to) read through the code, copy it, alter it, or try making your own version. Please do note that I am completely self-taught, and thus the code may be quite unoptimized and unorganized, though I'll try my best to fully comment.  
			<br><br>
			Hover over each circle to read a brief discription of each project and the math behind it. The interactive models will also include instructions. Then click on the circle to be transfered over to the project. If you'd like to know more about who I am and why I made this site, or if you have suggestions or questions, just hover over the "About" circle. Thanks for visiting!

				<h1>3D Fractal Trees</h1>
				<p>
					This model takes the 2D Fractal Tree (which you should check out first) and adds a dimension. The process of creating the tree is basically the same, the new branch length is a fraction of their parent and they are rotated by an angle (in this case pi/8). Due to the limitations of the method I used to create the new points, the branches radiate out in random directions.
					<br><br>
					To create a new set of branches, just click. You can do this up to 7 times, and you'll probably quickly realize why. There is no angle slider this time (because they don't look that great), but you'll get a unique tree each time you refresh the page. You may realize that some of these trees look quite realistic, and it may be becuase nature follows similar rules when creating new branches.

				<h1>Strange Attractor</h1>
				<p>
					Certain dynamic systems, over time, will tend towards a set of values. These values, which are reached for a wide range of initial conditions, are considered attractors. An attractor is then considered strange if it has a fracal-like structure, which is common for chaotic systems, in which an arbitrarily samll difference in initial conditions can lead to an arbitrarily large difference over time. This specific system is named Thomas' cyclically symetric attractor, and it's generated with a b value of 0.12.
					<br><br>
					This system was generated utilizing Euler's method, using the set of differential equations defined for Thomas' attractor. Initial points are generated randomly between -1 and 1 along all axes, and thus the structure will be slightly different when the webpage is refreshed.

				<h1>Diffusion Limited Aggregation</h1>
				<p>
					Diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) is a phenomena that arises due to Brownian motion, the random motion of particles in a solution. The structures, which are examples of Brownian Trees, are generated by first placing a "seed" in the center of the screen. Then, a particle is placed in the area surrounding that seed, and is allowed to randomly wander until it hits the seed, and attaches. This repeats ad infinitum, and a fractal-like structure grows as a result.
					<br><br>
					Within this model, the Brownian tree can be grown in real time (as long as the screen in open), though the process will take longer (linearly) over time. DLA clusters can actually be physically created using an electrodeposition cell.

				<h1>2D Fractal Trees</h1>
				<p>
					A 2D fractal tree is one of the simplest examples of a fractal, and can be quite easily understood. This structre starts with two points, which define the "trunk" of the tree. From one end of this line, two more branch out at a specific angle, and the length of these braches are some fraction of the parent brach. This process repeats ad infinitum, resulting in a fractal structure. The self-similarity of fractals is easily visible within this example, as each branch can be viewed as a smaller version of the entire tree.
					<br><br>
					Within this model, simply click to generate the next set of branches, though there is a limit (for your computer's sake). You can change the angle between the branches using the slider at the bottom. Change the angle between each click to make crazy trees. Hit the reset button to restart.

				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>
					So you'd like to know more about me, huh. Well, I'm a college student majoring in chemical engineering with a passion for (and pursuing a minor in) mathematics. In the little free time I have, I like to throw together these animations/interactive displays showcasing some of the interesting concepts I've come across. I create these for a few reasons: (1) I think they look cool, (2) to further explore these phenomena and see what I can discover, (3) to challenge myself through coding, and finally (4) I'd like to show others how cool they look. You're one of the "others". 
					<br></br>
					If you're wondering why I've chosen JavaScript and HTML canvas as a framework for these projects, it's becuase it makes it easy to share. I realize that I could create much more powerful and robust models using dedicated software, but then it would be a lot harder to show off (not to mention it makes interactivity easy). If you're wondering how to create these on your own, Codecademy is a great place to start for general coding, and just search "html canvas" on YouTube to find a few quick and easy tutorials on animations using canvas. 
					<br></br>
					If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, you can shoot me an email at nants0000@gmail.com, though I probably won't respond to quickly. You can also check out the github repository for this webpage. I hope you enjoy your time exploring this site, and check back every once-in-a-while for new projects or updates to current ones!

				<h1>Mass Spring System</h1>
				<p>
					If you've taken differential equations, you'll likely recognize this sort of system. Mass-spring systems are a common example because they can be modelled relatively easily with second order differential equations. The equation used to model this system is written at the top of the project screen, and takes in the inputs of object mass, a damping coefficient, a spring coefficient, and an external force function. The movement is generated using a special form of Euler's method that is applicable to second order differential equations.
					<br><br>
					Within this model, all four of the input variables can be varied, and a multitude of forcing functions can be picked from. You can also change the position of the mass by clicking (hold to preview).

				<h1>1D Fourier Series</h1>
				<p>
					Continuous functions, even those that are non-differentiable, can be represented as a Fourier series. These series consist of an infinite sum of sinusoidal functions of varying frequencies and amplitudes.  
					<br><br>
					In this model, a Fourier series is represented as a sum of "clock hands". At the end of each hand is placed the center of the next "clock", or circle. The total of number of circles can be varies by the slider, which can then be applied by pressing one of the three buttons. The "random" button generates random amplitudes and frequencies, while the two "preset" buttons follow a pattern for a sawtooth and square wave, respectively. Note how the function approaches the actual wave as the number of circles increases.

				<h1>2D Fourier Series</h1>
				<p>
					As explained in the 1D version of this model, any continuous function can be broken down into an infinite series of sinusoidal functions of varying amplitude and frequency. This actually includes all possible 2-dimensional (in a parametric-like sense) drawings as well. In fact, any image that can be drawn by a continuous line could be produced by this project, given the right amplitudes and frequencies.   
					<br><br>
					This model is very similar to the 1D version. The total of number of circles can be varies by the slider, which can then be applied by pressing one of the three buttons. The "random" button generates random amplitudes and frequencies, while the two "preset" buttons follow a pattern. Note how the function approaches straight lines and corners as the number of circles increases.

				<h1>Chaos Game</h1>
				<p>
					The rules of the Chaos game are simple: You start with a number of reference points and a single "main" point. Each iteration, a random reference point is chosen and the main point moves a fraction of the distance towards it. By repeating this process and drawing the main point each time, interesting fractal patterns can be generated.   
					<br><br>
					In this model, the sliders can be used to change a few parameters. The first is the number of reference points. The second is the set of potentially modified rules the game follows. The third is the fractional distance moved each step. The last slider indicates whether the reference points are spaced evenly or generated randomly (with a little spacing restriction). Inspired by a Numberphile video and a post by u/MegaOoga on r/math.

				<h1>Network Spread</h1>
				<p>
					In light of the present situation with coronavirus, I've created this model to further demonstrate the effect and usefulness of social distancing. This model simulates the spread of disease through a group of individuals represented by a network, or graph. The disease spreads over the edges between nodes, representing personal interaction.
					<br><br>
					To use the model, simply click to just forward one iteration. The density of the graph can be changed with the slider, and the model can be reset with the refresh button. While rudimentary, this model can help illusrate how limiting interpersonal connection can help limit and delay the spread of disease. Notice how more iterations/time is required for the disease to spread at lower densities.

				<h1>Repeated Games</h1>
				<p>
					Game theory is a field which seeks to model the strategies and rational decision making of players. One famous game theory model is called Prisoner's Dilemma, which has far-reaching applications in a wide variety of fields, from psychology to economics to even biology. This interative model is specifically based around repeated Prisoner's Dilemma, where players face off multiple times.
					<br><br>
					Within repeated games, players can have a number of strategies as to which action they will play, in this case cooperating or defecting. This model pits these strategies against each other, removing the lowest performers between "generations". Hover over the model components for further descriptions/instructions.

				<h1>Curl Noise</h1>
				<p>
					Fluid flow systems are relatively complex, and thus computational models utilizing iterative solution methods often require long runtimes and are unable to generate live demos. This model utilizes a method called curl noise to generate procedural fluid flow. 
					<br><br>
					This model was outline in the paper "Curl-Noise for Procedural Fluid Flow" by R. Bridson et al. Essential time dependent perlin noise is modified to meet the qualifications for an incompressible fluid (divergence free). This generates an underlying velocity field, which the particles flow through. This model makes use of the noisejs library created by GitHub user josephg (Thanks!).

				<h1>Random Walkers</h1>
				<p>
					This model utilizes Perlin noise to generate organic movement. See the "flow field" project for a more detailed explaination of Perlin noise. Within this model, the noise is used to create organic movement variations within lines I'll call "walkers".
					<br><br>
					The use of Perlin noise creates organic looking designs, especially with the addition of a time-dependent color scheme. Refresh the page to get a new design each time! This model makes use of the noisejs library created by GitHub user josephg (Thanks!).

				<h1>Random Networks</h1>
				<p>
					Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that entails the study of networks composed of nodes and edges, generally represented as circles connected by lines. While experimenting with network generation I stumbled upon some interesting designs when coloring triangles encircled by edges. 
					<br><br>
					In this model, the sliders can be used to change a few parameters. The first is the color scheme, the second is the number of nodes, the third is the minimum distance between nodes. The fourth is the maximum furthest neightboring node to which an edge can form. For example if this value is 4, an edge can form between a node and anywhere from the first to fourth closest node. If no network is generated it is becuase there are too many nodes for the required spacing.
