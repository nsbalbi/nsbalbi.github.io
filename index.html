		<h1>Hi!</h1>
		<p>
			My name is Nick, and I make math animations for fun (yes, really). I've put together this website to showcase some of them and to hopefully pass on the same wonder and fascination I've had for these concepts. Feel free to (in fact I encourage you to) read through the code, copy it, alter it, or try making your own version. Please do note that I am completely self-taught, and thus the code may be quite unoptimized and unorganized, though I'll try my best to fully comment.  
			<br><br>
			Hover over each circle to read a brief discription of each project and the math behind it. The interactive models will also include instructions. Then click on the circle to be transfered over to the project. If you'd like to know more about who I am and why I made this site, or if you have suggestions or questions, just hover over the "About" circle. Thanks for visiting!

				<h1>3D Fractal Trees</h1>
				<p>
					This model takes the 2D Fractal Tree (which you should check out first) and adds a dimension. The process of creating the tree is basically the same, the new branch length is a fraction of their parent and they are rotated by an angle (in this case pi/8). Due to the limitations of the method I used to create the new points, the branches radiate out in random directions.
					<br><br>
					To create a new set of branches, just click. You can do this up to 7 times, and you'll probably quickly realize why. There is no angle slider this time (because they don't look that great), but you'll get a unique tree each time you refresh the page. You may realize that some of these trees look quite realistic, and it may be becuase nature follows similar rules when creating new branches.

				<h1>Strange Attractor</h1>
				<p>
					Certain dynamic systems, over time, will tend towards a set of values. These values, which are reached for a wide range of initial conditions, are considered attractors. An attractor is then considered strange if it has a fracal-like structure, which is common for chaotic systems, in which an arbitrarily samll difference in initial conditions can lead to an arbitrarily large difference over time. This specific system is named Thomas' cyclically symetric attractor, and it's generated with a b value of 0.12.
					<br><br>
					This system was generated utilizing Euler's method, using the set of differential equations defined for Thomas' attractor. Initial points are generated randomly between -1 and 1 along all axes, and thus the structure will be slightly different when the webpage is refreshed.

				<h1>Diffusion Limited Aggregation</h1>
				<p>
					Diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) is a phenomena that arises due to Brownian motion, the random motion of particles in a solution. The structures, which are examples of Brownian Trees, are generated by first placing a "seed" in the center of the screen. Then, a particle is placed in the area surrounding that seed, and is allowed to randomly wander until it hits the seed, and attaches. This repeats ad infinitum, and a fractal-like structure grows as a result.
					<br><br>
					Within this model, the Brownian tree can be grown in real time (as long as the screen in open), though the process will take longer (linearly) over time. DLA clusters can actually be physically created using an electrodeposition cell.

				<h1>2D Fractal Trees</h1>
				<p>
					A 2D fractal tree is one of the simplest examples of a fractal, and can be quite easily understood. This structre starts with two points, which define the "trunk" of the tree. From one end of this line, two more branch out at a specific angle, and the length of these braches are some fraction of the parent brach. This process repeats ad infinitum, resulting in a fractal structure. The self-similarity of fractals is easily visible within this example, as each branch can be viewed as a smaller version of the entire tree.
					<br><br>
					Within this model, simply click to generate the next set of branches, though there is a limit (for your computer's sake). You can change the angle between the branches using the slider at the bottom. Change the angle between each click to make crazy trees. Refresh the page to reset.

				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>
					So you'd like to know more about me, huh. Well, I'm a college student majoring in chemical engineering with a passion for (and pursuing a minor in) mathematics. In the little free time I have, I like to throw together these animations/interactive displays showcasing some of the interesting concepts I've come across. I create these for a few reasons: (1) I think they look cool, (2) to further explore these phenomena and see what I can discover, (3) to challenge myself through coding, and finally (4) I'd like to show others how cool they look. You're one of the "others". 
					<br></br>
					If you're wondering why I've chosen JavaScript and HTML canvas as a framework for these projects, it's becuase it makes it easy to share. I realize that I could create much more powerful and robust models using dedicated software, but then it would be a lot harder to show off (not to mention it makes interactivity easy). If you're wondering how to create these on your own, Codecademy is a great place to start for general coding, and just search "html canvas" on YouTube to find a few quick and easy tutorials on animations using canvas. 
					<br></br>
					If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, you can shoot me an email at nants0000@gmail.com, though I probably won't respond to quickly. You can also check out the github repository for this webpage. I hope you enjoy your time exploring this site, and check back every once-in-a-while for new projects or updates to current ones!
